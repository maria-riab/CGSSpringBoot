# CGSSpringBoot
This is for our final Java course where we had to create a system for a college that tracks all their students,courses and grades earned per class. 
The project uses Spring Boot, with thymeleaf to create and style our web pages. We used lombok to simplify our code a bunch. We used both Oracle SQL and MySQL 
to store our data because each team member had a different DB on their computer. JPA was used to handle all of our DB interactions and made the whole process very smooth.
